# How to Push Radius to GitHub

You have successfully initialized the local repository and committed your code!
Now, follow these steps to get it on GitHub.

### 1. Create a Repository on GitHub
1.  Go to [new repository](https://github.com/new).
2.  **Repository Name**: `radius` (or whatever you prefer).
3.  **Visibility**: Private (Recommended for now).
4.  **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or License (we already have them).
5.  Click **Create repository**.

### 2. Connect and Push
Copy the commands shown on the GitHub page under "…or push an existing repository from the command line". They will look like this:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/radius.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Run these commands in your terminal here.

### 3. Verify
Refresh the GitHub page to see your code!
